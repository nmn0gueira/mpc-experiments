# MP-SPDZ


## TBD
- Fix installing from source (might need it if I need to change some parameters for certain protocols)
- See how to compile to boolean circuits through python
- Find out how to better structure the MP-SPDZ compilation and running process

### Optimizations
- Certain operations can be optimized with multiple threads like for_range_opt_multithread() and certain protocol parameters (I believe)
